## About

> This application was made as an assignment for my "Programming Fundamentals" class during the second period of my first semester at Fontys University. Besides that, it is also a nice exercise for me personally to get better at MVC, and OOP in general.

> I decided to go with .NET Core rather than a winforms application because during semester 2 we will be focussing on work with .NET Core. For styling I went with Bootstrap 4 and jQuery as it came out of the box with the default .NET Core (MVC) project.
