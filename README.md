## About

> This application was made as an assignment for my "Programming Fundamentals" class and my "Software" class during the second period of my first semester at Fontys University.
>
> Initially I decided to go with .NET Core rather than a winforms application because during semester 2 we will be focussing on work with .NET Core, but in the end I decided to go with a winforms application after all. The reason being that I would like to understand this tech as best as I can before moving on to something new. A headstart for the second semester would be nice, but right now I think it's more important that I better understand winforms and become a little more adapt with those. There is still plenty of time to get good at other tech like .NET Core.
